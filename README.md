# README: Gretel Assignment - Generate Synthetic Data
## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of Gretel AI tools to create high-quality synthetic datasets with strong privacy guarantees, adhering to strict financial services privacy requirements. We assume the schema to be:

- customer_id
- transaction_date
- transaction_amount
- transaction_type
- transaction_category
- account_balance

Using Gretel's tools, a synthetic dataset matching the provided schema was created. To simulate a "real" dataset, we generated one using `gretel.factories.initialize_navigator_api`. However, in earlier iterations, the `account_balance` column produced unrealistic values. To address this, we implemented a custom function to calculate `account_balance` based on the `transaction_amount` grouped by `customer_id`. 

We then train a `tabular-lstm` model, achieving an "excellent" Synthetic Quality Score (SQS) and Data Privacy Score. This confirms the synthetic dataset is suitable for machine learning or statistical analysis and can be shared internally and externally without compromising data privacy.


## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

1. **`00_gretel_assignment_generate_real_data.ipynb`**:
   - Creates a synthetic dataset based on the given schema. This is to be used as a standin for the "real" data
   - Implements a function to calculate account_balance

2. **`01_gretel_assignment_generate_synthetic_data.ipynb`**:
   - Trains a generative model using Gretel tools to synthesize data
   - Generates and evaluates the Synthetic Data Quality Score (SQS)
   - Provides a detailed walkthrough of the Gretel SDK for synthesizing data

3. **`data/`**:
   - Contains CSV files capturing the intermediate datasets from the transformation and synthetic data generation processes:
     - `starting_amounts.csv`
     - `synthetic_data.csv`
     - `transactions_merged.csv`
     - `trasactions_only.csv`

4. **`report/`**:
   - Contains an HTML file with the Synthetic Data Quality Score (SQS) report generated by Gretel:
     -  `tabular-lstm-report.html`


## Requirements

To execute the notebooks, ensure the following prerequisites:

- **Libraries**:
  - Gretel SDK (`gretel-client`)
  - Pandas
- **Gretel Account**: Sign up at [Gretel](https://gretel.ai) and acquire API credentials.
- **Environment**:
  - Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab for running the notebooks.
